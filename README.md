# Customer_Churn_Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict which telecom customers are likely to leave. By analyzing customer behavior, service usage, and interactions, it helps identify key reasons for churn. The goal is to optimize models for better accuracy and provide insights that help companies retain customers and reduce losses.

# Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses aiming to retain valuable customers. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features such as demographics, account information, and usage patterns.

 # Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on customer demographics, account details, and usage statistics. It includes features such as age, gender, tenure, service usage, and whether the customer has churned.

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and outliers.
Encoded categorical variables.
Scaled numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed the distribution of features.
Identified correlations between features and the target variable.
Model Selection:

Trained multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Optimized model parameters using GridSearchCV.
Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

# Results
The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, indicating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn. The analysis also provided insights into key factors influencing customer attrition.
